## About
The term ***"rotary"*** generally refers to something that involves or operates through rotation or circular motion. Derived from the Latin word *rotare*, meaning "to rotate," it is commonly used across various fields including mechanics, engineering, medicine, and organizational contexts.

In mechanical and engineering settings, "rotary" typically describes systems, devices, or tools that rely on rotational movement to function. For example:

- A ***rotary engine*** generates power through spinning components rather than the up-and-down motion found in traditional piston engines.
- A ***rotary tool*** is a handheld power tool with a rotating tip used for cutting, sanding, or polishing.

In medicine, the term can describe anatomical movements, such as rotary motion of joints.

In a more abstract or organizational sense, such as in Rotary International, it refers to a global humanitarian service organization. In this context, "rotary" originates from the practice of rotating meeting locations among members' businesses.

Overall, the core idea of "rotary" is fundamentally linked to rotation, circular operation, or periodic movement.
